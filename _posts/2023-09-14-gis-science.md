## Is GIS a Science? 


In my personal  experience in GIS classes, GIS can be considered a science. This is particularly true when there is an emphasis on documentation and reproducibility. For example, producing workflows and annotating code to ensure that others can understand and reproduce methodology. When considering [Wright’s (1997)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0004-5608.872057) definitions of formal science (purely abstract thought such as mathematics or physics), compared to substantive science (phenomena that exist outside of thought in the natural world), GIS frequently fits into the category of the latter. Furthermore, since GIS analysis is grounded in place, I think that it can best be described as a substantive science. This grounding in place and physical phenomena, along with efforts in GIS classes to encourage students to make workflows categorize GIS more as a scientific discipline in my mind. 

However, in the world of corporate GIS, at companies such as ESRI, GIS is often framed as a singular technology that is universally applicable for problem solving. In this regard, GIS is both framed and used as a one tool in a tool-box for better understanding spatial data.
