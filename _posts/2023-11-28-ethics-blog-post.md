## Why do geographers contemplate geographic threats to validity - and why everyone else should too
In one final discussion blog post, letâ€™s revisit the implications of geographic threats to validity in the context of your selected replication or reproduction project. Which threats to validity matter for your study, and do you have any suggestions about how to deal with them? This discussion can be integrated into your project report!

In the field of geography, understanding sources of uncertainty is critical to conducting valid research. However, in the field of geogrpahy education, the term uncertainty has varied in its definition and conceptualization. For the purposes of this reflection,...



#### How do geographers teach risk and uncertainty in geospatial research?

Understanding geographic threats to research validity are an integral aspect of conducting effective and accurate geospatial research. At the core, the main geographic threats to validity are:

- Boundary/Edge Effects
- Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem
- Scale Dependency
- Spatial Dependency/Autocorrelation
- Spatial Nonstationarity
- Spatial Heteogeneity

Furthermore, when teaching geospatial scicence, geography professors have an ethical obligation to teach about these core threats to ensure that future generations of geographers are able to identify where sources of risk and uncertainty may arise in geographic research.

However, there is spatial heterogeneoty in the teaching methods that are effective at various educational levels and scales regarding pedagogical approaches to teaching about geographic threats to validity.

For example, in the field of economics, [Underdwood et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2023.2234425) finds that through teaching core principals of open science, their undergaduate students are conducting more valid and reproducible research through transparent coding practicies and compiling replication documentaiton.

After teaching students about geographic threats, _____ et al. has found that their students conduct more valid and ____ research that....

These findings are particularly true when students are able to utilize real- world data and learn from the shortcomings and sources of uncertainty in published research.

Learning these lessons prepares students to work on real-world applications.

Incorporating a geographic perspective into research methods is an integral method for...

For the discipline of geography, it is not sufficient to replicate


In geospatial research, it appears that one integral challenege emerges from trying to effectively visually convey uncertainty in geospatial findings. Representing uncertainty in spatial knowledge is particularly challegenging, especially since maps are frequently interpreted as authoratative represenations of reality.  


Couclelis (2003) demonstrates the pervasiveness of uncertainty in the production process of geographical knowledge. Moreover, across the literature it appears that there is agreement in that scientific work is enriched rather than hindered by addressing sources of uncertainty in research. Therefore, it is critical that geogrpahy professors integrate lessons on uncertainty, particularly geographic threats to validity in core geography curriculmn.

In the conclusion of their paper, [Fusco (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X17718838) asserts that geographers should accept that uncertainty is an integral part of their research that should be acknowleged and reduced when possible.
