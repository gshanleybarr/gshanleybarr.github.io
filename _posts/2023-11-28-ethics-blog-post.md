#### A Systematic Literature Review of Lessons Learned from Undergaduate Pedagogical Approaches to Teaching Open Scinece Across Disciplines

For my final project for the class Open GIScience I conducted a systematic literature review concerning pedagogical approaches to teaching GIScience across disciplines and how these findings can inform how professors teach undergraduate students Open Science in the field of geography.

The core aims of the literature review are three-fold:
1. Identify what skills and competencies are needed to teach open science.
2. Identify lessons learned, proficiencies gained, benefits, and positive outcomes as a result of incorporating open science into curriculumn.  
3. Identify metrics to use to measure positive outcomes.
