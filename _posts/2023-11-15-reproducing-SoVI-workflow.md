#### Reproducing a Social Vulnerability Analysis Workflow

The exercise of attempting to reproduce [Kang et. al’s (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x) social vulnerability analysis workflow highlighted the importance of clarity and specificity when writing the methodology of a research paper. Many aspects of Kang et. al’s (2020) data manipulation and analysis are not explicitly discussed in the paper. Furthermore, this lack of methodological clarity raised issues with reproducibility and uncertainty, impeding efforts to make science more easily replicable. In this process, challenges arose and compounded with one ambiguous data processing step, increasing the uncertainty of the reproduction analysis. In the future, it is critical that in research compendiums, researchers provide clear workflows for their data processing and analysis to support the reproducibility and replicability of their research.
